###### Systems Administrator
Following a sebattical of sorts (during which I worked to refresh my AV skills and persue independant education & business endeavors), I was welcomed back to mumms to take the reigns as a full Systems Administrator. I returned ot my role as deployment lead and embarked on overhauling our notification system, as well as working more closely with the engineering & management teams to advance company goals.

###### Junior Systems Administrator
After serving on the IT support team for two years and increasing myknowledge and responsibilities along the way, I was promoted to this position to work directly with the senior sysadmin team to support application deployment using version control (git, svn, cvs), cfengine & bash scripting.
I was also tasked with software-developer support such as maintaince of devlopment, staging & production servers, access control using LDAP & cfengine-managed sudoers files.
Additionally several server operations & maintenance responsibilities including updating and maintaining DNS, firewall, VPN, and PBX systems (to name a few).

###### IT Technician
I was responsible for end-user hardware & software support as well as maintenance and deployment for a growing fleet of Apple Mac OS X desktops
& laptops.
I handled IT aspects of initial employee on-boarding and low level client
onboarding. These tasks included cloning computers from a standard system
images which I developed with my manager and peers, LDAP account creation
using WorkGroup Manager in OS X Server. I also performed basic database
management to allow new customers & developers to get started using our
systems.
My ability to see beyond employee problems & get at their underlying needs & blockages led to a reputation for making complex issues easier to deal with, as well as being able to fix issues quickly.

##### National WWII Museum - AV Technician
This position is responsible for maintenance & repair of the AV aspects of the interactive exhibits across the campus, including: A "4D" projection movie theater with moving practical effects, a fully interactive submarine simulation, interactive touchscreen kiosks with sound & video elements, and various other sound & visual exhibits using loudspeakers and video projection. Technicians are also tasked with supporting 3rd party event rentals of our
venues, typically including mics and video routing & projection.

My IT & AV background has allowed me to quickly learn interconnected systems (such as our mobile video live-streaming rig) and even become a bit of a go-to Subject Matter Expert to my coworkers. As an experienced engineer with very good interpersonal skills, I developed a reputation for being easy to work with while delivering excellent AV support.
